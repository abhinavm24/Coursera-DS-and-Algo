Learning Objectives
continue practicing implementing dynamic programming solutions
learn more complex applications of dynamic programming
implement efficient solutions to various problems in combinatorial optimization 


Fractional knapsack
 - Greedy works well for this problem
Discrete knapsack
 - Greedy doesn't work well for this problem because you never account will you fill remaining capacity of knapsack appropriately
 - knapsack with limited capacity
 - knapsack with unlimited capacity
    - Dynamic programming solution - try to solve subproblems first
    - try to find ways to fill bags with smaller capacity first
    - increase capacity of bags in small units

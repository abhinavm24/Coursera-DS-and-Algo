Binary Search Trees
In this module we study binary search trees, which are a data structure for doing searches on dynamically changing ordered sets. You will learn about many of the difficulties in accomplishing this task and the ways in which we can overcome them. In order to do this you will need to learn the basic structure of binary search trees, how to insert and delete without destroying this structure, and how to ensure that the tree remains balanced.


Learning Objectives
Describe how balanced binary search trees work
Analyze the running time of operations with binary search trees
List the capabilities of binary search trees
Compare balanced binary search trees with arrays and lists

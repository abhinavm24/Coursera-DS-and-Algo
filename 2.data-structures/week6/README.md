Binary Search Trees 2
In this module we continue studying binary search trees. We study a few non-trivial applications. We then study the new kind of balanced search trees - Splay Trees. They adapt to the queries dynamically and are optimal in many ways.


Learning Objectives
Describe how to implement advanced operations using balanced binary search trees
Describe how splay trees work
Analyze the running time of operations with splay trees
Apply amortized analysis to splay trees
Apply binary search trees in programming challenges
Develop a balanced binary search tree
